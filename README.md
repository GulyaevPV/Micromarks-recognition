BINARY CLASSIFICATION OF REFERENCE MICROMARKS IMAGES IN PROBE MICROSCOPY USING CONVENTIONAL PROCESSING METHODS
The task of binary classification (recognition) of microlabeling images and background surface relief obtained in the process of micromarks searching for using a probe microscope is considered. Typical images of markings consisting of segments oriented to each other at right angles are presented. The analysis of the possibilities of conventional processing methods for recognizing markings on images is carried out. A classification algorithm based on Erosion operation, threshold filtration and Hough transform is described. Metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions are given.
